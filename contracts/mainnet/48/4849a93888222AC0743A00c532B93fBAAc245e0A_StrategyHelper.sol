/**
 * @dev Contract module that allows children to implement role-based access
 * control mechanisms. This is a lightweight version that doesn't allow enumerating role
 * members except through off-chain means by accessing the contract event logs. Some
 * applications may benefit from on-chain enumerability, for those cases see
 * {AccessControlEnumerable}.
 *
 * Roles are referred to by their `bytes32` identifier. These should be exposed
 * in the external API and be unique. The best way to achieve this is by
 * using `public constant` hash digests:
 *
 * ```solidity
 * bytes32 public constant MY_ROLE = keccak256("MY_ROLE");
 * ```
 *
 * Roles can be used to represent a set of permissions. To restrict access to a
 * function call, use {hasRole}:
 *
 * ```solidity
 * function foo() public {
 *     require(hasRole(MY_ROLE, msg.sender));
 *     ...
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Roles can be granted and revoked dynamically via the {grantRole} and
 * {revokeRole} functions. Each role has an associated admin role, and only
 * accounts that have a role's admin role can call {grantRole} and {revokeRole}.
 *
 * By default, the admin role for all roles is `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, which means
 * that only accounts with this role will be able to grant or revoke other
 * roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using
 * {_setRoleAdmin}.
 *
 * WARNING: The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is also its own admin: it has permission to
 * grant and revoke this role. Extra precautions should be taken to secure
 * accounts that have been granted it. We recommend using {AccessControlDefaultAdminRules}
 * to enforce additional security measures for this role.

 * Sets have the following properties:
 *
 * - Elements are added, removed, and checked for existence in constant time
 * (O(1)).
 * - Elements are enumerated in O(n). No guarantees are made on the ordering.
 *
 * ```solidity
 * contract Example {
 *     // Add the library methods
 *     using EnumerableSet for EnumerableSet.AddressSet;
 *
 *     // Declare a set state variable
 *     EnumerableSet.AddressSet private mySet;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * As of v3.3.0, sets of type `bytes32` (`Bytes32Set`), `address` (`AddressSet`)
 * and `uint256` (`UintSet`) are supported.
 *
 * [WARNING]
 * ====
 * Trying to delete such a structure from storage will likely result in data corruption, rendering the structure
 * unusable.
 * See https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11843[ethereum/solidity#11843] for more info.
 *
 * In order to clean an EnumerableSet, you can either remove all elements one by one or create a fresh instance using an
 * array of EnumerableSet.

 * @title Dopex V2 Automated Liquidity Management for Arbitrum STIP Rewards
 * @author Orange Finance
 * @notice This contract is tailored for optimizing liquidity positions within the Dopex V2 protocol
 * on the Arbitrum network, specifically for the STIP rewards program. It automatically adjusts liquidity
 * within a range of ±2.5% from the current market price, ensuring eligibility for STIP rewards while aiming
 * to maximize returns and minimize risks associated with price volatility.
 *
 * Key Features:
 * 1. Targeted Liquidity Range: Maintains liquidity positions within ±2.5% of the current market price,
 *    aligning with the requirements of the Dopex V2 STIP rewards program.
 * 2. Automated Adjustments: Reacts to market changes and automatically adjusts positions to stay within
 *    the optimal range for rewards and risk mitigation.
 * 3. Enhanced Yield Potential: By focusing on a narrow price range, the strategy aims to capture higher
 *    trading fees and STIP rewards.
 *
 * Risk:
 * - This strategy keep traking current price with narrow range that potentially cause huge divergence loss depending on market condition.
 *
 * @dev some internal calls have "this." prefix, but this is for testing that utlize mockCall powered by Foundry.
