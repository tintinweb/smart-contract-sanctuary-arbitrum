    Considerations:

        - Who will the tax go to, a hard-coded address or a specific tax collector?
            - Tax Collector (we will set this with a setter function w/ onlyOwner: modifier)
        - How does Buy tax work?
            - When user buys tokens from the DEX - LP takes token X and provides TaxToken to the user.
              The tax will be applied to the amount of tokens the user receives.
        - How does Sell tax work?
            - When the user sells tokens to the DEX - LP takes TaxToken and provides token X to the user.
              The tax is applied to the amount of tokens the user sells. 
        - How do we ensure transferring tokens to LP is untaxed
            - We define mapping(address => bool) and ensure the LP contract address is exempt.
        - How do I get my token on to a DEX?
                - Requires creating a Uniswap Liquidity Pool and then providing the token pairs to that pool.
        - How will a DEX interact with my token?
        - Can I use any DEX or would it have to be a specific DEX with support for Tax Tokens?
