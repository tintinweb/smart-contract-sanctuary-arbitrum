/**
 * @title DutchTrade
 * @notice Implements a wholesale dutch auction via a 4-piecewise falling-price mechansim.
 *   The overall idea is to handle 4 cases:
 *     1. Price manipulation of the exchange rate up to 1000x (eg: via a read-only reentrancy)
 *     2. Price movement of up to 50% during the auction
 *     3. Typical case: no significant price movement; clearing price within expected range
 *     4. No bots online; manual human doing bidding; additional time for tx clearing
 *
 *   Case 1: Over the first 20% of the auction the price falls from ~1000x the best plausible
 *   price down to 1.5x the best plausible price in a geometric series.
 *   This period DOES NOT expect to receive a bid; it just defends against manipulated prices.
 *   If a bid occurs during this period, a violation is reported to the Broker.
 *   This is still safe for the protocol since other trades, with price discovery, can occur.
 *
 *   Case 2: Over the next 20% of the auction the price falls from 1.5x the best plausible price
 *   to the best plausible price, linearly. No violation is reported if a bid occurs. This case
 *   exists to handle cases where prices change after the auction is started, naturally.
 *
 *   Case 3: Over the next 50% of the auction the price falls from the best plausible price to the
 *   worst price, linearly. The worst price is further discounted by the maxTradeSlippage.
 *   This is the phase of the auction where bids will typically occur.
 *
 *   Case 4: Lastly the price stays at the worst price for the final 5% of the auction to allow
 *   a bid to occur if no bots are online and the only bidders are humans.
 *
 * To bid:
 * 1. Call `bidAmount()` view to check prices at various future timestamps.
 * 2. Provide approval of sell tokens for precisely the `bidAmount()` desired
 * 3. Wait until the desired time is reached (hopefully not in the first 20% of the auction)
 * 4. Call bid()
 *
 * Limitation: In order to support all chains, such as Arbitrum, this contract uses block time
 *             instead of block number. This means there may be small ways that validators can
 *             extract MEV by playing around with block.timestamp. However, we think this tradeoff
 *             is worth it in order to not have to maintain multiple DutchTrade contracts.
