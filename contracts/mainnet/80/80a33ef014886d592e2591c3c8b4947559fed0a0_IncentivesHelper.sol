/**
 * @dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed
 * behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an
 * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer
 * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.
 *
 * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be
 * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each "step" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in
 * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```solidity
 * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {
 *     function initialize() initializer public {
 *         __ERC20_init("MyToken", "MTK");
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {
 *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {
 *         __ERC20Permit_init("MyToken");
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as
 * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.
 *
 * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure
 * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.
 *
 * [CAUTION]
 * ====
 * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.
 *
 * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation
 * contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke
 * the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```
 * /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor
 * constructor() {
 *     _disableInitializers();
 * }
 * ```

/**
 * StdChains provides information about EVM compatible chains that can be used in scripts/tests.
 * For each chain, the chain's name, chain ID, and a default RPC URL are provided. Chains are
 * identified by their alias, which is the same as the alias in the `[rpc_endpoints]` section of
 * the `foundry.toml` file. For best UX, ensure the alias in the `foundry.toml` file match the
 * alias used in this contract, which can be found as the first argument to the
 * `setChainWithDefaultRpcUrl` call in the `initializeStdChains` function.
 *
 * There are two main ways to use this contract:
 *   1. Set a chain with `setChain(string memory chainAlias, ChainData memory chain)` or
 *      `setChain(string memory chainAlias, Chain memory chain)`
 *   2. Get a chain with `getChain(string memory chainAlias)` or `getChain(uint256 chainId)`.
 *
 * The first time either of those are used, chains are initialized with the default set of RPC URLs.
 * This is done in `initializeStdChains`, which uses `setChainWithDefaultRpcUrl`. Defaults are recorded in
 * `defaultRpcUrls`.
 *
 * The `setChain` function is straightforward, and it simply saves off the given chain data.
 *
 * The `getChain` methods use `getChainWithUpdatedRpcUrl` to return a chain. For example, let's say
 * we want to retrieve the RPC URL for `mainnet`:
 *   - If you have specified data with `setChain`, it will return that.
 *   - If you have configured a mainnet RPC URL in `foundry.toml`, it will return the URL, provided it
 *     is valid (e.g. a URL is specified, or an environment variable is given and exists).
 *   - If neither of the above conditions is met, the default data is returned.
 *
 * Summarizing the above, the prioritization hierarchy is `setChain` -> `foundry.toml` -> environment variable -> defaults.
