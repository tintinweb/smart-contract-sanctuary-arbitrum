/**
 * @dev Implementation of the {IERC20} interface.
 *
 * This implementation is agnostic to the way tokens are created. This means

 * For a generic mechanism see {ERC20PresetMinterPauser}.
 *
 * TIP: For a detailed writeup see our guide
 * https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226[How
 * to implement supply mechanisms].
 *
 * The default value of {decimals} is 18. To change this, you should override
 * this function so it returns a different value.
 *
 * We have followed general OpenZeppelin Contracts guidelines: functions revert
 * instead returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless
 * conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20
 * applications.
 *
 * Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.
 * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
 * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
 * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.
 *
 * Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}
 * functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting
 * allowances. See {IERC20-approve}.

/**
 * @dev Interface of the ERC20 Permit extension allowing approvals to be made via signatures, as defined in
 * https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612[EIP-2612].
 *
 * Adds the {permit} method, which can be used to change an account's ERC20 allowance (see {IERC20-allowance}) by
 * presenting a message signed by the account. By not relying on {IERC20-approve}, the token holder account doesn't
 * need to send a transaction, and thus is not required to hold Ether at all.
 *
 * ==== Security Considerations
 *
 * There are two important considerations concerning the use of `permit`. The first is that a valid permit signature
 * expresses an allowance, and it should not be assumed to convey additional meaning. In particular, it should not be
 * considered as an intention to spend the allowance in any specific way. The second is that because permits have
 * built-in replay protection and can be submitted by anyone, they can be frontrun. A protocol that uses permits should
 * take this into consideration and allow a `permit` call to fail. Combining these two aspects, a pattern that may be
 * generally recommended is:
 *
 * ```solidity
 * function doThingWithPermit(..., uint256 value, uint256 deadline, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) public {
 *     try token.permit(msg.sender, address(this), value, deadline, v, r, s) {} catch {}
 *     doThing(..., value);
 * }
 *
 * function doThing(..., uint256 value) public {
 *     token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), value);
 *     ...
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Observe that: 1) `msg.sender` is used as the owner, leaving no ambiguity as to the signer intent, and 2) the use of
 * `try/catch` allows the permit to fail and makes the code tolerant to frontrunning. (See also
 * {SafeERC20-safeTransferFrom}).
 *
 * Additionally, note that smart contract wallets (such as Argent or Safe) are not able to produce permit signatures, so
 * contracts should have entry points that don't rely on permit.

/**
 * @title YearnV3 Base Strategy
 * @author yearn.finance
 * @notice
 *  BaseStrategy implements all of the required functionality to
 *  seamlessly integrate with the `TokenizedStrategy` implementation contract
 *  allowing anyone to easily build a fully permissionless ERC-4626 compliant
 *  Vault by inheriting this contract and overriding three simple functions.

 *  It utilizes an immutable proxy pattern that allows the BaseStrategy
 *  to remain simple and small. All standard logic is held within the
 *  `TokenizedStrategy` and is reused over any n strategies all using the
 *  `fallback` function to delegatecall the implementation so that strategists
 *  can only be concerned with writing their strategy specific code.
 *
 *  This contract should be inherited and the three main abstract methods
 *  `_deployFunds`, `_freeFunds` and `_harvestAndReport` implemented to adapt
 *  the Strategy to the particular needs it has to generate yield. There are
 *  other optional methods that can be implemented to further customize
 *  the strategy if desired.
 *
 *  All default storage for the strategy is controlled and updated by the
 *  `TokenizedStrategy`. The implementation holds a storage struct that
 *  contains all needed global variables in a manual storage slot. This
 *  means strategists can feel free to implement their own custom storage
 *  variables as they need with no concern of collisions. All global variables
 *  can be viewed within the Strategy by a simple call using the
 *  `TokenizedStrategy` variable. IE: TokenizedStrategy.globalVariable();.
