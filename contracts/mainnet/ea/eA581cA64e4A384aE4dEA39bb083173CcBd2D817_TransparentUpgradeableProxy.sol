/**
 * @dev Library for reading and writing primitive types to specific storage slots.
 *
 * Storage slots are often used to avoid storage conflict when dealing with upgradeable contracts.
 * This library helps with reading and writing to such slots without the need for inline assembly.
 *
 * The functions in this library return Slot structs that contain a `value` member that can be used to read or write.
 *
 * Example usage to set ERC1967 implementation slot:
 * ```solidity
 * contract ERC1967 {
 *     bytes32 internal constant _IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT = 0x360894a13ba1a3210667c828492db98dca3e2076cc3735a920a3ca505d382bbc;
 *
 *     function _getImplementation() internal view returns (address) {
 *         return StorageSlot.getAddressSlot(_IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT).value;
 *     }
 *
 *     function _setImplementation(address newImplementation) internal {
 *         require(Address.isContract(newImplementation), "ERC1967: new implementation is not a contract");
 *         StorageSlot.getAddressSlot(_IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT).value = newImplementation;
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * _Available since v4.1 for `address`, `bool`, `bytes32`, `uint256`._
 * _Available since v4.9 for `string`, `bytes`._

 *
 * To avoid https://medium.com/nomic-labs-blog/malicious-backdoors-in-ethereum-proxies-62629adf3357[proxy selector
 * clashing], which can potentially be used in an attack, this contract uses the
 * https://blog.openzeppelin.com/the-transparent-proxy-pattern/[transparent proxy pattern]. This pattern implies two
 * things that go hand in hand:
 *
 * 1. If any account other than the admin calls the proxy, the call will be forwarded to the implementation, even if
 * that call matches the {ITransparentUpgradeableProxy-upgradeToAndCall} function exposed by the proxy itself.
 * 2. If the admin calls the proxy, it can call the `upgradeToAndCall` function but any other call won't be forwarded to the
 * implementation. If the admin tries to call a function on the implementation it will fail with an error indicating the
 * proxy admin cannot fallback to the target implementation.
 *
 * These properties mean that the admin account can only be used for upgrading the proxy, so it's best if it's a dedicated
 * account that is not used for anything else. This will avoid headaches due to sudden errors when trying to call a function
 * from the proxy implementation. For this reason, the proxy deploys an instance of {ProxyAdmin} and allows upgrades
 * only if they come through it.
 * You should think of the `ProxyAdmin` instance as the administrative interface of the proxy, including the ability to
 * change who can trigger upgrades by transferring ownership.
 *
 * NOTE: The real interface of this proxy is that defined in `ITransparentUpgradeableProxy`. This contract does not
 * inherit from that interface, and instead `upgradeToAndCall` is implicitly implemented using a custom dispatch mechanism
 * in `_fallback`. Consequently, the compiler will not produce an ABI for this contract. This is necessary to fully
 * implement transparency without decoding reverts caused by selector clashes between the proxy and the
 * implementation.
 *
 * NOTE: This proxy does not inherit from {Context} deliberately. The {ProxyAdmin} of this contract won't send a
 * meta-transaction in any way, and any other meta-transaction setup should be made in the implementation contract.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: This contract avoids unnecessary storage reads by setting the admin only during construction as an immutable variable,
 * preventing any changes thereafter. However, the admin slot defined in ERC-1967 can still be overwritten by the implementation
 * logic pointed to by this proxy. In such cases, the contract may end up in an undesirable state where the admin slot is different
 * from the actual admin.
 *
 * WARNING: It is not recommended to extend this contract to add additional external functions. If you do so, the compiler
 * will not check that there are no selector conflicts, due to the note above. A selector clash between any new function
 * and the functions declared in {ITransparentUpgradeableProxy} will be resolved in favor of the new one. This could
 * render the `upgradeToAndCall` function inaccessible, preventing upgradeability and compromising transparency.
