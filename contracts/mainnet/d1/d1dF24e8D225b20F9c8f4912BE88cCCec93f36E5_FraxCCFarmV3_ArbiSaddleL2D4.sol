// No veFXS logic
// Because of lack of cross-chain reading of the gauge controller's emission rate,
// the contract sets its reward based on its token balance(s)
// Rolling 7 day reward period idea credit goes to denett
// rewardRate0 and rewardRate1 will look weird as people claim, but if you track the rewards actually emitted,
// the numbers do check out
// V3: Accepts canonicalFXS directly from Fraxferry and does not swap out
