// We're trying to normalize all chances close to 100%, which is 100 000 with decimal point 10^3. Assuming this, we can get more "random"
// numbers by dividing the "random" number by this prime. To be honest most primes larger than 100% should work, but to be safe we'll
// use an order of magnitude higher (10^3) relative to the decimal point
// We're using uint256 (2^256 ~= 10^77), which means we're safe to derive 8 consecutive random numbers from each hash.
// If we, by any chance, run out of random numbers (hash being lower than the range) we can in turn
// use the remainder of the hash to regenerate a new random number.
// Example: assuming our hash function result would be 1132134687911000 (shorter number picked for explanation) and we're using
// % 100000 range for our drop chance. The first "random" number is 11000. We then divide 1000000011000 by the 100000037 prime,
// leaving us at 11321342. The second derived random number would be 11321342 % 100000 = 21342. 11321342/100000037 is in turn less than
// 100000037, so we'll instead regenerate a new hash using 11321342.
// Primes are used for additional safety, but we could just deal with the "range".
