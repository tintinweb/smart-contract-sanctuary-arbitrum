 *
 * ZklinkFastPool
 * ============
 *
 * Basic multi-signer wallet designed for use in a co-signing environment where 2 signatures are require to move funds.
 * Typically used in a 2-of-3 signing configuration. Uses ecrecover to allow for 2 signatures in a single transaction.
 *
 * The signatures are created on the operation hash and passed to withdrawETH/withdrawERC20
 * The signer is determined by ECDSA.recover().
 *
 * The signature is created with ethereumjs-util.ecsign(operationHash).
 * Like the eth_sign RPC call, it packs the values as a 65-byte array of [r, s, v].
 * Unlike eth_sign, the message is not prefixed.
