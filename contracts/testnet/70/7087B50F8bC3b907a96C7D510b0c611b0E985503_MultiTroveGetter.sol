/**
 * @dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed
 * behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an
 * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer
 * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.
 *
 * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be
 * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each "step" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in
 * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```solidity
 * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {
 *     function initialize() initializer public {
 *         __ERC20_init("MyToken", "MTK");
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {
 *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {
 *         __ERC20Permit_init("MyToken");
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as
 * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.
 *
 * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure
 * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.
 *
 * [CAUTION]
 * ====
 * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.
 *
 * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation
 * contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke
 * the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```
 * /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor
 * constructor() {
 *     _disableInitializers();

/*
 * A sorted doubly linked list with nodes sorted in descending order.
 *
 * Nodes map to active Troves in the system - the ID property is the address of a Trove owner.
 * Nodes are ordered according to their current nominal individual collateral ratio (NICR),
 * which is like the ICR but without the price, i.e., just collateral / debt.
 *
 * The list optionally accepts insert position hints.
 *
 * NICRs are computed dynamically at runtime, and not stored on the Node. This is because NICRs of active Troves
 * change dynamically as liquidation events occur.
 *
 * The list relies on the fact that liquidation events preserve ordering: a liquidation decreases the NICRs of all active Troves,
 * but maintains their order. A node inserted based on current NICR will maintain the correct position,
 * relative to it's peers, as rewards accumulate, as long as it's raw collateral and debt have not changed.
 * Thus, Nodes remain sorted by current NICR.
 *
 * Nodes need only be re-inserted upon a Trove operation - when the owner adds or removes collateral or debt
 * to their position.
 *
 * The list is a modification of the following audited SortedDoublyLinkedList:
 * https://github.com/livepeer/protocol/blob/master/contracts/libraries/SortedDoublyLL.sol
 *
 *
 * Changes made in the Vesta implementation:
 *
 * - Keys have been removed from nodes
 *
 * - Ordering checks for insertion are performed by comparing an NICR argument to the current NICR, calculated at runtime.
 *   The list relies on the property that ordering by ICR is maintained as the ETH:USD price varies.
 *
 * - Public functions with parameters have been made internal to save gas, and given an external wrapper function for external access
