 * @title Instant Distribution Agreement interface
 * @author Superfluid
 *
 * @notice 
 *   - A publisher can create as many as indices as possibly identifiable with `indexId`.
 *     - `indexId` is deliberately limited to 32 bits, to avoid the chance for sha-3 collision.
 *       Despite knowing sha-3 collision is only theoretical.
 *   - A publisher can create a subscription to an index for any subscriber.
 *   - A subscription consists of:
 *     - The index it subscribes to.
 *     - Number of units subscribed.
 *   - An index consists of:
 *     - Current value as `uint128 indexValue`.
 *     - Total units of the approved subscriptions as `uint128 totalUnitsApproved`.
 *     - Total units of the non approved subscription as `uint128 totalUnitsPending`.
 *   - A publisher can update an index with a new value that doesn't decrease.
 *   - A publisher can update a subscription with any number of units.
 *   - A publisher or a subscriber can delete a subscription and reset its units to zero.
 *   - A subscriber must approve the index in order to receive distributions from the publisher
 *     each time the index is updated.
 *     - The amount distributed is $$\Delta{index} * units$$
 *   - Distributions to a non approved subscription stays in the publisher's deposit until:
 *     - the subscriber approves the subscription (side effect),
 *     - the publisher updates the subscription (side effect),
 *     - the subscriber deletes the subscription even if it is never approved (side effect),
 *     - or the subscriber can explicitly claim them.
