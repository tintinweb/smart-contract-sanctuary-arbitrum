/**
 * @title Floor Token
 * @author Trader Joe
 * @notice The Floor Token contract is made to be inherited by an ERC20-compatible contract.
 * It allows to create a floor for the token, which guarantees that the price of the token will never go below
 * the floor price. On every transfer, the floor will be rebalanced if needed, that is if the amount of token Y
 * available in the pair contract allows to raise the floor by at least one bin.
 * WARNING: The floor mechanism only works if the tokens that are minted are only minted and added as liquidity
 * to the pair contract. If the tokens are minted and sent to an account, the floor mechanism will not work.
 * The order of the tokens should never be changed.

 * The default value of {decimals} is 18. To change this, you should override
 * this function so it returns a different value.
 *
 * We have followed general OpenZeppelin Contracts guidelines: functions revert
 * instead returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless
 * conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20
 * applications.
 *
 * Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.
 * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
 * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
 * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.
 *
 * Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}
 * functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting
 * allowances. See {IERC20-approve}.
