 * @dev Library for managing an enumerable variant of Solidity's
 * https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/types.html#mapping-types[`mapping`]
 * type.
 *
 * Maps have the following properties:
 *
 * - Entries are added, removed, and checked for existence in constant time
 * (O(1)).
 * - Entries are enumerated in O(n). No guarantees are made on the ordering.
 *
 * ```
 * contract Example {
 *     // Add the library methods
 *     using EnumerableMap for EnumerableMap.UintToAddressMap;
 *
 *     // Declare a set state variable
 *     EnumerableMap.UintToAddressMap private myMap;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * The following map types are supported:
 *
 * - `uint256 -> address` (`UintToAddressMap`) since v3.0.0
 * - `address -> uint256` (`AddressToUintMap`) since v4.6.0
 * - `bytes32 -> bytes32` (`Bytes32ToBytes32Map`) since v4.6.0
 * - `uint256 -> uint256` (`UintToUintMap`) since v4.7.0
 * - `bytes32 -> uint256` (`Bytes32ToUintMap`) since v4.7.0
 *
 * [WARNING]
 * ====
 * Trying to delete such a structure from storage will likely result in data corruption, rendering the structure
 * unusable.
 * See https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11843[ethereum/solidity#11843] for more info.
 *
 * In order to clean an EnumerableMap, you can either remove all elements one by one or create a fresh instance using an
 * array of EnumerableMap.
