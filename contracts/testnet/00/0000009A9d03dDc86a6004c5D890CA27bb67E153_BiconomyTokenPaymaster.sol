 * The manager must convert these collected tokens back to native gas and deposit it into the EntryPoint to keep the system running.
 * It is an extension of VerifyingPaymaster which trusts external signer to authorize the transaction, but also with an ability to withdraw tokens.
 *
 * The validatePaymasterUserOp function does not interact with external contracts but uses an externally provided exchange rate.
 * Based on the exchangeRate and requiredPrefund amount, the validation method checks if the user's account has enough token balance. This is done by only looking at the referenced storage.
 * All Withdrawn tokens are sent to a dynamic fee receiver address.
 *
 * Optionally a safe guard deposit may be used in future versions.
