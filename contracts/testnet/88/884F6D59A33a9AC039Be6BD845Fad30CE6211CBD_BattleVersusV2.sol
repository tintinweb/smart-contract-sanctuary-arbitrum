// use the remainder of the hash to regenerate a new random number.
// Example: assuming our hash function result would be 1132134687911000 (shorter number picked for explanation) and we're using
// % 100000 range for our drop chance. The first "random" number is 11000. We then divide 1000000011000 by the 100000037 prime,
