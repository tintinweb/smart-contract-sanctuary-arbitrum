 * @dev Library for managing

 *
 * Sets have the following properties:
 *
 * - Elements are added, removed, and checked for existence in constant time
 * (O(1)).
 * - Elements are enumerated in O(n). No guarantees are made on the ordering.
 *
 * ```
 * contract Example {
 *     // Add the library methods
 *     using EnumerableSet for EnumerableSet.AddressSet;
 *
 *     // Declare a set state variable
 *     EnumerableSet.AddressSet private mySet;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * As of v3.3.0, sets of type `bytes32` (`Bytes32Set`), `address` (`AddressSet`)
 * and `uint256` (`UintSet`) are supported.
 *
 * [WARNING]
 * ====
 *  Trying to delete such a structure from storage will likely result in data corruption, rendering the structure unusable.
 *  See https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11843[ethereum/solidity#11843] for more info.
 *
 *  In order to clean an EnumerableSet, you can either remove all elements one by one or create a fresh instance using an array of EnumerableSet.

/**
  The Cron contract is a chainlink keepers-powered cron job runner for smart contracts.
  The contract enables developers to trigger actions on various targets using cron
  strings to specify the cadence. For example, a user may have 3 tasks that require
  regular service in their dapp ecosystem:
    1) 0xAB..CD, update(1), "0 0 * * *"     --> runs update(1) on 0xAB..CD daily at midnight
    2) 0xAB..CD, update(2), "30 12 * * 0-4" --> runs update(2) on 0xAB..CD weekdays at 12:30
    3) 0x12..34, trigger(), "0 * * * *"     --> runs trigger() on 0x12..34 hourly

  To use this contract, a user first deploys this contract and registers it on the chainlink
  keeper registry. Then the user adds cron jobs by following these steps:
    1) Convert a cron string to an encoded cron spec by calling encodeCronString()
    2) Take the encoding, target, and handler, and create a job by sending a tx to createCronJob()
    3) Cron job is running :)

/*
  The Cron contract serves two primary functions:
    * parsing cron-formatted strings like "0 0 * * *" into
      structs called "Specs"
    * computing the "next tick" of a cron spec

  Because manipulating strings is gas-expensive in solidity,
  the intended use of this contract is for users to first convert
  their cron strings to encoded Spec structs via toEncodedSpec().
  Then, the user stores the Spec on chain. Finally, users use the nextTick(),
  function to determine the datetime of the next cron job run.

  Cron jobs are interpreted according to this format:

  ┌───────────── minute (0 - 59)
  │ ┌───────────── hour (0 - 23)
  │ │ ┌───────────── day of the month (1 - 31)
  │ │ │ ┌───────────── month (1 - 12)
  │ │ │ │ ┌───────────── day of the week (0 - 6) (Monday to Sunday)
  │ │ │ │ │
  │ │ │ │ │
  │ │ │ │ │
  * * * * *

  Special limitations:
    * there is no year field
    * no special characters: ? L W #
    * lists can have a max length of 26
    * no words like JAN / FEB or MON / TUES

/*
 * @title String & slice utility library for Solidity contracts.
 * @author Nick Johnson <[email protected]>
 *
 * @dev Functionality in this library is largely implemented using an
 *      abstraction called a 'slice'. A slice represents a part of a string -
 *      anything from the entire string to a single character, or even no
 *      characters at all (a 0-length slice). Since a slice only has to specify
 *      an offset and a length, copying and manipulating slices is a lot less
 *      expensive than copying and manipulating the strings they reference.
 *
 *      To further reduce gas costs, most functions on slice that need to return
 *      a slice modify the original one instead of allocating a new one; for
 *      instance, `s.split(".")` will return the text up to the first '.',
 *      modifying s to only contain the remainder of the string after the '.'.
 *      In situations where you do not want to modify the original slice, you
 *      can make a copy first with `.copy()`, for example:
 *      `s.copy().split(".")`. Try and avoid using this idiom in loops; since
 *      Solidity has no memory management, it will result in allocating many
 *      short-lived slices that are later discarded.
 *
 *      Functions that return two slices come in two versions: a non-allocating
 *      version that takes the second slice as an argument, modifying it in
 *      place, and an allocating version that allocates and returns the second
 *      slice; see `nextRune` for example.
 *
 *      Functions that have to copy string data will return strings rather than
 *      slices; these can be cast back to slices for further processing if
 *      required.
 *
 *      For convenience, some functions are provided with non-modifying
 *      variants that create a new slice and return both; for instance,
 *      `s.splitNew('.')` leaves s unmodified, and returns two values
 *      corresponding to the left and right parts of the string.
